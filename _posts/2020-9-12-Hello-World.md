## Hi, everyone!

Before formally opening this space, I would like to take a couple of minutes to present myself so you can know a bit of the person who is on the other side of screen =)

My full name is Daniel Orozco García, Orozco García are my last names, we use two in Mexico (fun fact: if you take my initials, you get the word DOG). I was born a little bit more than 25 years ago in Veracruz, Mexico. Ever since I can remember, I've been a very curious and a bit logical person. As a kid, it was common to find me assembling and disassembling my toys; I loved to create "robots" and "buildings" out of construction bricks and tiny cups of a famous Petit Suisse cheese (hint: the pack displays a dinosaur character). I also enjoyed wathching animated movies, I had a big collection of VHS's. Also, my uncle used to have an SNES that we played together, no matter I was only 2 years old.

Time passed by and I started to explore The Arts; there was this painting club back in junior high school (or whatever you call the school you attend when you are 13, sorry, I always get confused) which I joined, and got to participate in the creation of some mural paintings in the outside walls of the school (I swear we were not vandilizing the school haha). After that, I also got interested in music and enrolled in classes to learn how to play the keyboard and electric guitar, which lasted about 3 years.

For a long time, I had an internal conflict due to the apparent incompatibility of my "artistic" and "logical" sides. On one hand, my favorite classes were Physics and Math so I was told that I should study some kind of engineer's degree, but on the other, all of my notebooks were full of tiny sketches and my house was (and still is) full of framed paintings I made, and some people suggested me to get into graphic design / digital arts.

It wasn't until I took a Game Design Diploma, that I discovered the existence of certain role in Game and Film industry called Technical Artist (and a bunch of variations that I might talk about later). This is a pretty interesting role. It's description changes from studio to studio and so the tasks that a Technical Artist has to accomplish. But, if there is something that everyone agrees is that a Technical Artist is someone that bridges the Art and Programming departments; someone who develops tools to quickly integrate the visual assets into a project. And, being as curious as I am, once I knew about this, I couldn't stop researching about the topic and I've been learning and studying ever since :)

It has been a long time since I wanted to start this project. What I want to do is to have a space to document my learnings and outcomes of my little "experiments" so I can review them in other moment; besides having the possibility to share them so it can help someone else too.

I of course don't know everything and there is always more than one way to come to a solution for most of the problems, so I am also open to discuss with you if you have a suggestion or question of any kind. Feel free to reach out to me!

Well, let's start this, shall we?
See you on the next post!
