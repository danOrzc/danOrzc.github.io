UnincrediBall is a 3 v 3 brawler - sports game where the player takes control of one out of six unique super heroes.

The game was made in Unreal Engine by a six person core team and fourteen collaborators.

My tasks on the project included modelling the game arena and its props, designing and implementing the different particle effects found on the game, developing the materials, making the art for the UI and facilitating the implementation of character animations through the Animation Graph.
