I'm a guy from Mexico that really likes Digital Art but also is kinda lazy to do it manually... so I find ways to do it automatically! When I'm not working, you can find me studying or researching new techniques and workflows, or just finding the answers to random questions I sometimes get.

I have experience working in Unreal Engine, Unity, Maya, Houdini, Substance Painter, Substance Designer, Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects, Premiere.
